## The Breakdown

For this week, we are tasked with creating a node-based questionnaire that takes in user-input, and outputs it into an HTML template. Upon completion of the questionnaire, an HTML file, as well as a CSS file, is generated with the user's input data.
This HTML will display a series of cards, each containing specialized criteria depending on the person's job status.

Lets breakdown the Acceptance Criteria:

```
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
```

- This is saying that a newly generated HTML file is contingent on the data that the user inputs; it wil not generate otherwise.

```
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
```

-

```
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
```

-

```
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
```

-

```
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
```

-

```
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
```

-

```
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
```

-

```
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```
